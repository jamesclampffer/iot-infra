Arduino sketch that implements a simple emitter node on an ESP8266

Check out the example BasicHttpClient, this firmware just extends that.

Forwards IO:
- A0: the only ADC
- D4: One of 2 GPIOs that aren't used for other peripherals
- D5: The second GPIO (see above)

Notes:
- not optimized at all, intended to be easy to hack up
- data collector and mock emitters will need a few updates to handle uuid

Tested on:
- "wemos mini D1" clone board, any esp8266 should work. Pin assignments
  might need to be changed depending on HAL.
- Run with stack protection enabled and optimizations disabled. Flash is
  a little tight (some might be due to a fixed-size blob) but there is no
  shortage of RAM.
  - Will be interested to see if heap fragmentation becomes an issue. Most
    of those allocs happen inside the ESP/Arduino code though.


Issues:
- Need to sort out IP attribution
