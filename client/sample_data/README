# Collected Data

This directory contains real-world data collected from the devices I'm using for my process automation needs.

## Contents

- Sample data files collected from actual device polling sessions. Stored in Python pickle format for simplicity.
- No processing done other than filtering or replacing things like SSID and MAC address.

### Data Bias
- My personal focus is on shop automation and equipment utilization info to drive informed budget allocation. Data collection will be heavily skewed towards these use cases.

## Usage

Use these files for:
- Validating system assumptions, replay tests
- Identifying equipment-specific signals that can be extracted from the data. Basic things like utilization and duty cycle through predictive maintenance.

**Note:** Data may contain brittle and device-specific information. Handle appropriately.

### Example files
compressor_data.json
- Result of a "Shelly.GetStatus" RPC done on ~0.5s intervals
- Includes some discontinuity. Downstream stuff needs to be robust to that.
- Timing jitter due to how polling was done. Two sets of timestamps: when the poller process received it and when the device claimed it broadcasted it. Downstream analysis is expected to be able to interpolate small gaps.
