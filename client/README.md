Client for embedded devices on the local network

Loosely based on Shelly's interface and naming conventions https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/gen2/


Classes:\
MockDevice: A program that exposes a superset of the API any embedded node would expose for hardware-free testing.\
ShellyClient: A library that can speak some of the shelly API dielect. Will be generalized once there's enough test coverage to make regressions unlikely.
